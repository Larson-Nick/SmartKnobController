# Smart Knob Controller

The Smart Knob Controller is an exploration of how brushless DC motors can breathe new life into one of the most ubiquitous input deviceâ€”the humble knobâ€”by enabling dynamic, software-configurable feedback. The result is a clean, tactile, dual-degree-of-freedom controller that feels like multiple knobs in one: snappy detents, elastic spring force, or a completely free-spinning dial. The only limit is your creativity.
